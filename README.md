## 🔹 Goals

The primary goal of this project was to transform static Goodreads data into a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard that promotes reading through data-driven insights. The focus was on tracking key metrics such as:

- 📊 Book ratings
- 📚 Genre distribution
- ✍️ Author activity
- 📈 Reading trends across historical eras
- 💡 Miscellaneous insights

---

## 🔹 Business Needs Addressed

This dashboard fulfills the need for engaging visual summaries that can be leveraged by:

- **Readers** to discover new books and authors
- **New authors** to understand genre trends and market positioning
- **Educators and librarians** to identify popular trends for curriculum or library planning
- **Businesses/platforms like Goodreads** to enhance user engagement through interactive data storytelling
- **Entertainment industry professionals** to gain insights for potential book adaptations

---

## 🔹 Approach to Insights

Using **Power BI**, I:

- Imported, cleaned, and modeled the Goodreads dataset
- Created interactive visuals, including:
  - 📊 Genre and author distribution pie charts
  - 📆 Book releases by historical era
  - ⭐ Rating breakdowns and 📏 page range distribution
  - 📖 Top 10 books by reviews and comments

To enhance interactivity and insight discovery, I incorporated filters for:

- Genre
- Rating
- Author
- Era

The dashboard emphasizes **clarity**, **consistency**, and **storytelling**, helping users uncover meaningful patterns—like the surge in book publications during the 21st century or the most prolific authors by number of releases.
